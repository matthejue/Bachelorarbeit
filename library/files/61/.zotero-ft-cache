Is there some place where I can get a list of all Visual C++ compiler/linker errors/warnings ? I am looking for both the error/warning number and the error/warning text that is displayed by the compiler. MSDN has them all, but they are linked to on individual pages.

    Good question. I'd like to know, too. MSDN doesn't bother presenting them in any sort of convenient format.

Apparently, none exists: googling for a single page containing all the terms lnk1000 lnk1003 c4100 yields no results.

I think you'll have to compile a reference yourself by painstaking navigation through this MSDN section .

Al list of all warnings for VS2015 and VS2017 can be found at sections such as C++ Core Guidelines Checker Reference , Code Analysis for C/C++ Warnings , and other related sections linked from the References header in the left menu.

For example, here is a document describing C6001: using uninitialized memory [variable] .

I am not sure if there is a single page covering all warning codes, but lacking one, you can clone the documentation sources and search through it yourself: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/tree/master/docs/code-quality
